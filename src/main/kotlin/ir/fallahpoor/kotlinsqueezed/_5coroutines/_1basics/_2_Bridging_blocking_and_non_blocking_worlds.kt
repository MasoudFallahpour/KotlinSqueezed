     * - It is a coroutine builder that bridges the non-coroutine and the coroutine worlds.

     *   of the call, until all the coroutines inside runBlocking { ... } complete their execution.

     * HERE GOES MY THOUGHT

     * current thread meaning that the current thread should wait idle until the code block inside
     * the runBlocking is finished. But the weired thing is that the thread that runs the code block
     * inside the runBlocking is the current thread!
