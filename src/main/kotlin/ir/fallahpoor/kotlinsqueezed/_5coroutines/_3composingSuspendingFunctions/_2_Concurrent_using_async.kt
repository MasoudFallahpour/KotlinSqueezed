     * What if there are no dependencies between invocations of doSomethingUsefulOne and

     * This is where 'async' comes to help.
     *
     * Conceptually, 'async' is just like 'launch'. It starts a coroutine. The difference is that
     * 'launch' returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value, while 'async' returns a
     * Deferred â€” a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide a result
     * later. You can use .await() on a Deferred to get its eventual result. Deferred is also a
     * Job, so you can cancel it if needed.
