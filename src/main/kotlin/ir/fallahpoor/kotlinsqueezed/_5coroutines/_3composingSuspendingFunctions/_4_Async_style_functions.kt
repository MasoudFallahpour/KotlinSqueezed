     * Consider what happens if between the val one = somethingUsefulOneAsync() line and one.await()
     * expression there is some logic error in the code and the program throws an exception and the
     * operation that was being performed by the program aborts. Normally, a global error-handler could
     * catch this exception, log and report the error for developers, but the program could otherwise
     * continue doing other operations. But here we have somethingUsefulOneAsync still running in the
     * background, even though the operation that initiated it was aborted. This problem does not happen
     * with structured concurrency.
