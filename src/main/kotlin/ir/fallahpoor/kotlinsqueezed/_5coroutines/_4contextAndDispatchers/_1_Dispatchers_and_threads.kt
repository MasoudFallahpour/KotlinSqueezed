     * The coroutine context is a set of various elements. The main elements are the Job of the coroutine,
     * and its dispatcher.
     *
     * The coroutine context includes a coroutine dispatcher that determines what thread or threads the
     * corresponding coroutine uses for execution. The coroutine dispatcher can confine coroutine execution
     * to a specific thread, dispatch it to a thread pool, or let it run unconfined.
     *
     * All coroutine builders like 'launch' and 'async' accept an optional CoroutineContext parameter that
     * can be used to explicitly specify the dispatcher for the new coroutine and other context elements.

     * from the CoroutineScope it is being launched from. In the example above, it inherits the context
     * of the main runBlocking coroutine which runs on the main thread.
     *
     * Dispatchers.Unconfined is a special dispatcher that also appears to run in the main thread, but
     * it is, in fact, a different mechanism that is explained later.
     *
     * The default dispatcher that is used when coroutines are launched in GlobalScope is represented
     * by Dispatchers.Default and uses a shared background pool of threads.
     *
     * newSingleThreadContext creates a thread for the coroutine to run.
