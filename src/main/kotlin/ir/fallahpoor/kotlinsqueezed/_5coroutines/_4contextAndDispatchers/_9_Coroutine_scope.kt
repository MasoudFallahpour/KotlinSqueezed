/**
 * Assume that our application has an object with a lifecycle, but that object is not a coroutine.
 * For example, we are writing an Android application and launch various coroutines in the context of
 * an Android activity to perform asynchronous operations to fetch and update data, do animations, etc.
 * All of these coroutines must be cancelled when the activity is destroyed to avoid memory leaks. We,
 * of course, can manipulate contexts and jobs manually to tie the lifecycles of the activity and its
 * coroutines, but kotlinx.coroutines provides an abstraction encapsulating that: CoroutineScope.
 *
 * We manage the lifecycles of our coroutines by creating an instance of CoroutineScope tied to the
 * lifecycle of our activity. A CoroutineScope instance can be created by the CoroutineScope() or
 * MainScope() factory functions. The former creates a general-purpose scope, while the latter creates
 * a scope for UI applications and uses Dispatchers.Main as the default dispatcher.
 *
 * Take a look at the following class.
